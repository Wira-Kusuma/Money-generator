# Money Generator

Money Generator is a simple web application built with JavaScript that simulates a "virtual money generator." This project is designed as a basic exercise in programming logic, DOM manipulation, localStorage, event handling, and interface management using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

## Features

- **Manual Money Addition**  
  Users can manually add money by clicking a button.

- **Auto Generate**  
  Users can enable automatic money generation at set intervals (e.g., every 0.5 or 1 second) when they have enough funds.

- **Reset Money**  
  Users can reset their money to the initial value with a specific cost.

- **Local Data Storage**  
  The last money amount is saved in localStorage, so data persists even after refreshing the page.

- **Simple Interface**  
  The UI is designed to be simple and easy to use.

## How It Works

1. Users can increase their money manually.
2. Once the balance reaches a certain threshold, the auto generate feature can be activated.
3. When auto generate is enabled, money will increase automatically at regular intervals.
4. The reset feature allows users to reset their balance with a specified cost.
